# GWKarst version 1.0: groundwater simulation combining karst matrix and conduit flow
The GWKarst version 1.0 simulates groundwater flow (both matrix and conduit) of the karst grids. Combining the non-karst flow simulation with the non-karst model, it can simulate the streamflow for a catchment with a mixture of karst and non-karst areas. Here, a demo is created. 

To run the demo, open the file "RUN_main_script.m" and run it in MATLAB. The simulated result will be stored in the variable "result". See more details about the system requirements and instruction on how to run the demo in the readme.txt file under ./doc/.
